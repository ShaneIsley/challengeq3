Things to bear in mind when reading/updating this file:
  * The status column refers only to the latest information we are given, so it may be out of date
  * "working" doesn't necessarily mean "usable", see the notes column
  * Status is one of "working", "broken" or "unknown"
  * In the case of "broken" or "unknown" LKWR refers to the last known working revision
