<p>Quake 3 now runs natively on many platforms thanks to id Software for releasing the engine 
source code.</p>

<h2>What's the point?</h2>
<p>This project aims to build upon id Software's Quake 3 source code release.
The source was released on August 20, 2005 under the GPL license. Since then, we have
feverishly been cleaning up, fixing bugs of, and adding features to, Quake 3. Our eventual
goal is to have created <strong>the</strong> Quake3 source code distribution that people
base their games and mods with their own pointy goals upon. Our focus is initially
to get the game working with our updates on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux. Sane new features are also welcome. Modern graphical upgrades (bloom lighting, etc) would have to be disabled by dedfault
</p>
<h2>Progress.</h2>
<p>While a lot is on the horizon, quite a few goals have been completed already. Quake 3
now works natively on x86_64 and PowerPC architectures, and the game builds and runs
in FreeBSD. SDL is now used for input/context/sound, making the game far easier to port
to new platforms and architectures. Many security holes and other problems have been repaired. A more in-depth database
of new features, working status of platforms, and bugs is the <a href="?page=status">Status</a>
section.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
