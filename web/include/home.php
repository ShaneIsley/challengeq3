<p>Quake 3 now runs natively on many platforms thanks to ID Software releasing the engine 
source code.</p>

<h2>What's the point?</h2>
<p>This project is aiming to build upon the work of ID Software on Quake 3 source code.
The source was released on August 20, 2005 under the GPL license. Since then, we have
feverishly been cleaning up, fixing bugs of, and adding features to Quake 3. Our eventual
goal is to have created <strong>the</strong> Quake3 source code distribution that people
base their games and forks with their own pointed goals upon. Our focus is initially
to get the game working everywhere. Sane new features are also smiled upon.
</p>
<h2>Progress.</h2>
<p>While a lot is on the horizon, quite a few goals have been completed already. Quake 3
now works natively on x86_64 and PowerPC architectures, and the game builds and runs
in FreeBSD. SDL is now used for about everything, making the game far easier to port
to new platforms and architectures. Many bugs have been fixed. A more in-depth database
of new features, working status of platforms, and bugs is the <a href="?page=status">Status</a>
section.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
