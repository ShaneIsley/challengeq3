
Jun 08 - 1.43

fixed sfx0 using a real sound and thus "hiding" it

corrected sv_pure back to CVAR_ROM

added the correct "fastsky!=0 == disable portals" test, ffs me  :P

removed long-obsoleted r_lastValidRenderer

removed long-obsoleted r_ext_gamma_control

removed pointless cl_forceavidemo

removed r_rail* and marked the never-used RT_BEAM etc as such

removed RAVENMD4 completely

r_fullbright is not a cheat var

fixed a bug with CVAR_CHEAT

fixed another bug in \video (hopefully)

fixed distance culling on dlit patch seams

changed r_ext_max_anisotropy default to 16

added con_scale for console font scaling
0 = Q3 style, always 8x12 pixels regardless of screen rez
1 = Q4 style, scales with screen rez
!0 = scale with screen rez and a custom multiplier

straightened out the con cvar mess:
cl_noprint -> con_noprint
scr_conspeed -> con_speed and correctly CVAR_ARCHIVE
con_notifytime correctly CVAR_ARCHIVE
removed cl_conXOffset since it basically doesn't work

sleep correctly if an unfocused client (win32-only)
don't sleep INcorrectly if a dedicated server (win32-only)

another MASSIVE overhaul of the sound code:

removed s_doppler, it's "right", but it just sounds like shit

removed s_mixprestep, a stupid hack to work around another stupid hack

spatialisation is now correct, which has two huge impacts:
  you can "place" sounds MUCH more accurately than before,
  but as a result, distant sounds are MUCH quieter

the defective OAL stuff we inherited has been nuked completely
i'm never going to fix it, and i'm tired of it poisoning the codebase


Mar 08 - 1.42

bots are no longer kicked by devmap

legacy cack like joystick/midi support only pollutes configs if enabled

fixed a memory leak in the sound code

fixed even more (hopefully all) dropped sound issues in snd_dma

made com_soundmegs SLIGHTLY less broken: now only 2x instead of 3x  :P
note that "soundmegs" are taken FROM THE HUNK now to fix the leak
so you need to increase com_hunkmegs by 2x your com_soundmegs

removed the explicit and incorrect "fastsky==1 == disable portals" test

r_noportals is not a cheat var

hyperspace is a bit less annoying

purged the unused (never finished) idMD4 model code

fixed some bugs in referencedpak list generation

fixed roqs ignoring s_volume

fixed widescreen modes crashing on listen servers

fixed downloads not completing properly


18 Feb 08 - 1.41

removed all bs references to GT_SINGLE_PLAYER and ui_singlePlayerActive
(except from the bot code, which has bigger problems)
added sv_singleplayer

improved TTF overhead a lot: now as fast as crappy bitmap fonts  :D

removed the stupidity of every key aborting demo playback: now ESC only

only play the id logo cin the FIRST time, not every fkn time

removed the broken stencil/projection shadow code

avis produced by \video actually work (bug+fix both from ioq3)

fixed some ABSURD buffer overruns and broken code in snd_dma
which caused random dropped sounds for no reason
it's a miracle it doesn't segfault any real OS
also dumped the unused-since-TA adpcm/mulaw/etc cruft

fixed a TA-era (surprise, surprise) bug that broke loopsound behavior

loop (ie ambient) sounds are now 75% volume

q3config is NEVER autowritten just because of bind/cvar changes
it sucks if you're playing and it sucks even more if you're on GTV
UI/SP code should write it EXPLICITLY if they want to save something


19 Dec 07 - 1.40

the code now requires a C++ compiler
MASSIVE cleanups of the codebase, tho still plenty of bits left

screenshot filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS-TTT
this means they'll never collide *; moviemakers won't run out;
and the engine DOESN'T STAT 10,000 FILES EVERY FRAME
(* except at 2am on an autumn night if you're amazingly unlucky :P)

demo filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS

fixed demos to be MAX_OSPATH instead of MAX_QPATH, ie 256 chars now

renamed cl_mouseAccel to m_accel

removed ioq3 "qkey" rubbish

removed support for BMP and PCX

removed fs_cdpath, fs_copyfiles, touchfile, fs_restrict

removed support for IPX

removed in_logitechbug

updated cpu detection

added TTF support

fixed a bunch of stuff in ScanAndLoadShaderFiles, but it's still crap

fixed the patch collision epsilon bugs of 1.34

reverted to id's tab-completion since ioq3's is so hated
i've semi-merged them atm, will fix up when i get time

interpreted vm is never used on platforms that support compiled vm

clampmaps and nomip images use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE rather than GL_CLAMP

disabled curl until it's brought up to standard

merged platform-specific *_net.* into qcommon/net_ip.cpp, <3 timbo  :)

fixed USERINFO vars not being sent properly during connect

remove some network stuff (buffer sizes and TOS) http://support.microsoft.com/kb/248611


12 Sep 07 - released as 1.34, since it was about time we did  :P

increased default MAX_POLYS to 8K and MAX_POLYVERTS to 32K


Aug 07

fixed a bug in the skybox code that tried to use a 0-length CVA
which makes recent nvidia drivers go into spaz mode 

changed r_ext_multisample default to 0 to stop ix nagging  :P


July 07

added support for curl

improved some network stuff (buffer sizes and TOS)

added support for mouse5-mouse8


1 May 07

remove broken useless cl_freezeDemo and make demo pausing work
just use timescale 0


27 Apr 07

ripped out all support for legacy substandard hw/drivers (ie Voodoo etc)
and r_maskMinidriver

uncorrected mode 8 back to 1280x1024

r_stencilbits: 0
r_picmip: 0
r_roundImagesDown: 0
r_simpleMipMaps: 0
s_useOpenAL: 0

default fs_game to cpma


30 Jun 06 - initial build from ioq3 svn v810

mode 8 corrected to 1280x960

undefined USE_OPENAL

removed GetUserName call

removed stupid+broken r_dlightbacks

created dlight texture correctly

fixed the dlight code

removed the explicit and incorrect "vertexlight==1 == disable dlights" test

removed redundant r_ext_texture_filter_anisotropic

removed retarded cl_consoleHistory

removed redundant cl_autoRecordDemo

shader spew made developer 1

gl extensions spew made developer 1

pak list made fs_debug 1

removed the TA cvars that were hacked into the engine

reordered demo_protocols to reduce spew
