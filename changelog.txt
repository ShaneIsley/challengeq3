
Mar 08 - 1.42

bots are no longer kicked by devmap

legacy cack like joystick/midi support only pollutes configs if enabled

fixed a memory leak in the sound code

fixed even more (hopefully all) dropped sound issues in snd_dma

made com_soundmegs SLIGHTLY less broken: now only 2x instead of 3x  :P
note that "soundmegs" are taken FROM THE HUNK now to fix the leak
so you need to increase com_hunkmegs by 2x your com_soundmegs

removed the explicit and incorrect "fastsky==1 == disable portals" test

r_noportals is not a cheat var

hyperspace is a bit less annoying

purged the unused (never finished) idMD4 model code

fixed some bugs in referencedpak list generation

fixed roqs ignoring s_volume


18 Feb 08 - 1.41

removed all bs references to GT_SINGLE_PLAYER and ui_singlePlayerActive
(except from the bot code, which has bigger problems)
added sv_singleplayer

improved TTF overhead a lot: now as fast as crappy bitmap fonts  :D

removed the stupidity of every key aborting demo playback: now ESC only

only play the id logo cin the FIRST time, not every fkn time

removed the broken stencil/projection shadow code

avis produced by \video actually work (bug+fix both from ioq3)

fixed some ABSURD buffer overruns and broken code in snd_dma
which caused random dropped sounds for no reason
it's a miracle it doesn't segfault any real OS
also dumped the unused-since-TA adpcm/mulaw/etc cruft

fixed a TA-era (surprise, surprise) bug that broke loopsound behavior

loop (ie ambient) sounds are now 75% volume

q3config is NEVER autowritten just because of bind/cvar changes
it sucks if you're playing and it sucks even more if you're on GTV
UI/SP code should write it EXPLICITLY if they want to save something


19 Dec 07 - 1.40

the code now requires a C++ compiler
MASSIVE cleanups of the codebase, tho still plenty of bits left

screenshot filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS-TTT
this means they'll never collide *; moviemakers won't run out;

(* except at 2am on an autumn night if you're amazingly unlucky :P)

demo filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS

fixed a bunch of stuff in ScanAndLoadShaderFiles, but it's still crap

fixed the patch collision epsilon bugs of 1.34

reverted to id's tab-completion since ioq3's is so hated
i've semi-merged them atm, will fix up when i get time

interpreted vm is never used on platforms that support compiled vm

clampmaps and nomip images use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE rather than GL_CLAMP

disabled curl until it's brought up to standard

merged platform-specific *_net.* into qcommon/net_ip.cpp, <3 timbo  :)

fixed USERINFO vars not being sent properly during connect

remove some network stuff (buffer sizes and TOS) http://support.microsoft.com/kb/248611


12 Sep 07 - released as 1.34, since it was about time we did  :P

increased default MAX_POLYS to 8K and MAX_POLYVERTS to 32K


Aug 07

fixed a bug in the skybox code that tried to use a 0-length CVA

30 Jun 06 - initial build from ioq3 svn v810

mode 8 corrected to 1280x960

undefined USE_OPENAL
