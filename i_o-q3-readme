Hello and welcome to the Quake 3 source repository on icculus.org
I'll be your maintainer, zakk@icculus.org, please send all your patches to me.
The intent of this is to give people a baseline Quake 3.
Bug fixes, SDL port, security.
Extra graphics and sound will be accepted as long as they are entirely
optional and off by default.

The map editor isn't included, get a modern copy from here:

cd code/unix && make
Refer to the web-site for updated status, enjoy!

Using shared libraries instead of qvm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make quake3 prefer shared libraries instead of qvm run it with
the following parameters:
+set sv_pure 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_game 0 +set vm_ui 0

Using Demo Data Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
you only need demoq3/pak0.pk3 from the demo installer. The qvm files inside
pak0.pk3 will not work, you have to use the native shared libraries from this
project. To do so copy or link ui*.so, qagame*.so, cgame*.so from baseq3 to
demoq3 and run quake3 with the parameters described above.

64bit mods
~~~~~~~~~~
To compile working(!) shared libraries for 64bit mods the vmMain and
dllEntry functions as well as the syscall pointer have to be changed
to accept and return long instead of int.
