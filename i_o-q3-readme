Hello and welcome to the Quake 3 source repository on icculus.org
I'll be your maintainer, zakk@icculus.org, please send all your patches to me.
The intent of this is to give people a baseline Quake 3. Bug fixes, SDL port, security. Extra graphics and sound will be accepted as long as they are entirely
optional and off by default.

The map editor isn't included, get a modern copy from here:
